# OpenRouter Model List (priority order)
# Lines starting with # are comments and ignored.
# Put one model id per line. Top to bottom = high to low priority.
# Example valid ids:
# - meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:free
# - mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct
# - qwen/qwen-2.5-32b-instruct
# - anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet (requires provider integration)
# NOTE: We will NOT fallback to openrouter/auto unless you add it here explicitly.
